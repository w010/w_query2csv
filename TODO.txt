- convert and merge readme + sxw docs into new documentation format
- add possibility to postprocess also on the very end (after htmlspecialchars etc)
- add possibility to process fieldnames in header row (traverse them to some nice labels, with spaces possible etc.)
- some easy way to insert links to csv in rte/cke or/and generate a list of links to configured files with nice labels
- LabelsFromRecords, LabelsFromMmRelations: try to find table and table_mm in TCA to not have to configure this (include info in debug)
